# MeanShift

Remember  
How many maximum number of clusters user can pass to MeanShift method?  
A: None  
D: Ideally infinity  
D: 100  
D: 10  

Understand  
What may happen if you keep the bandwidth parameter too small while building MeanShift clustering model?  
A: It may lead to the formation of too many clusters  
D: It may lead to the formation of very less number of clusters  
D: It may destabilize the building of MeanShift clustering.  
D: It may not affect the convergence of clustering process.  

Apply  
What is the runtime complexity of MeanShift clustering when iterated 50 times over 1600 data points?  
A: O(128000000)  
D: O(80000)  
D: O(2000)  
D: O(100000)  

Analyse
What happens when you set "cluster_all" argument of MeanShift clustering method to False?  
A: All the orphans are assigned to a new cluster with cluster label -1.  
D: All the orphans are assigned to their respective nearest clusters.  
D: All the orphans are assigned to a cluster with maximum number of data points.   
D: All the orphans are assigned to a cluster with minimum number of data points.
